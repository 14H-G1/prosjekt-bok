#Before starting
Make sure you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) installed. Remember to install Ruby's package manager, [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/). Since version 1.9 Ruby comes with RubyGems by default, while previous Ruby versions require to install it by hand.

Check if you have Ruby installed in a terminal/shell: `ruby -v`

#Installation

> This is quoted (& edited into Markdown) from http://sass-lang.com/install

Here's the quickest way we've found to start using Sass by using the command line:

1. __Open your Terminal or Command Prompt.__ On the Mac the Terminal.app comes installed by default. It's located in your "Utilities" folder. On Windows, run `cmd`.

2. __Install Sass.__ Ruby uses Gems to manage its various packages of code like Sass. In your open terminal window type:
`gem install sass`

3. __Double-check.__ You should now have Sass installed, but it never hurts to double-check. In your terminal application you can type: `sass -v`
It should return a version number of some kind. You've successfully installed Sass.
